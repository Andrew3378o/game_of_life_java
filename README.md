# Game of life implemented in Java 

Game of life or also known as the game without a player was created by mathematician John Conway.
It simulates life using four simple rules:

- a cell remains alive if it has two or three living neighbors;
- a cell dies due to "loneliness" if it has one neighbor or no living neighbors at all;
- a cell dies due to "overpopulation" if it has four or more living neighbors;
- a cell becomes alive if it has exactly three living neighbors.

It sounds pretty simple, but these four rules can lead to chaotic and unpredictable behavior, even when the initial conditions are fully known.
